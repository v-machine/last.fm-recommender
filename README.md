# last.fm-recommender
Term project for 15688 Practical Data Science.

## Overview
In this project we built and analyzed two end-to-end recommender systems for the music website Last. fm. We first gathered public user data, then trained and analyzed two recommender systems using collaborative filtering (user-based approach), with deep auto-encoder and matrix factorization respectively. Matrix factorization is implemented using Scikit-Learn, and auto encoder with PyTorch. Subsequently, we compared their performances in predicting users' preferences on an artificially generated test set (by masking songs as "unseen") and conduct analysis in relation to the nature of the data.
