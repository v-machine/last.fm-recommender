We will focused on user-based approach for it is the lighter approach that only takes into account users' past ratings of the songs. We will build two recommenders using a traditional approach of matrix factorization and a modern deep learning approach of deep autoencoder respectively. Subsequently, we will compare their performances in predicting users' preferences on songs masked as \"unseen\" and conduct analysis in relation to the nature of the data. "

    "While matrix factorization method with SVD had been the traditonally popular in collaboratie filtering based recommender systems, recent effort have increasing migrated toward deep learning technique. Kuchaiev and Ginsburg [1] had proposed a recommender architecture built using deep autoencoders. The authors found that the deep autoencoders generalized better than shallow once; while the use of non-linear activation with negative parts helps propagate gradients and finally, the heavy use of drop-out and regularization is crucial in preventing overfitting. Li et al [2] pointed out that traditional technique such as matrix factorization fall short on capturing non-linaring in the user-item interaction. They had demonstrated the potentials of a deep neural network while highlighting the challenge in training and overfitting. We follow closely techniques used the these papers, preprocessing of sparse input data, denosing using dropout as well as using computing loss with a zero-mask. \n",

    "We will mainly use Last.fm api to collect our data, where we can retrieve a set of users and their N most frequently played songs in a most recent window of time (for this project, the window is one month). The Last.fm API had provided just such method: `User.getTopTracks`. The caveat of using this method is that we'll need to pass in list of usernames as argument, which is not readily available for privacy reason. To get around this challenge, we will use the search phrase `site:last.fm/user/` on popular search engine website and scrape usernames. Our experiments had showed Bing by far returned the most number of usernames. __Importantly, as a good privacy practice, make sure that usernames are hashed before publishing any parts of the data harvested.__"

This indicates that a few number of hyper-ative users accounts for most of the user activities while a few popular songs amass most of the popularity. For most users, we also observe that far fewers songs have high play counts while the majority songs had only been listened to only a number of times. This is typically the case for most user-product matrix for there are far more products than ratings, while there are orders of magnitude more songs that a user glosses over than the few that ended up getting listened to repeadtly.

    "Now that We have completed data cleaning and preprocessing, it's time the prepare the data for the recommender training pipelines. We will first combine the lists of users IDs, song IDs and user ratings into a user-song matrix, with each entries being the user's rating [0.1, 1] and 0 if the song is unseen by the user. We will then split the matrix into three identically shaped matrixes: a training, validation and test matrix by randomly selecting a percentage of entries for each matrix(train=70%, val=20%, test=10%), while keep the rest entries zeros. The training set is used for training, while the validation set helps us tune the model and prevent overfitting. Finally, we will compare the user's actual rating in the test set against the predictions made by recommender. To help improve memory efficiency, we will use scipy's sparse matrix to store out training, validation and test data."

    "Before we start building our recommender models, it's important to get an overview of what they do. Recall that we have an extremely sparse user-song rating matrix. In user-based collaborative filtering, the recommender algorithm learns a representation of the underlying data distribution and \"densifies\" the sparse matrix in the process. This is true for both matrix factorization and deep autoencoder, which essentially peform dimension reduction of the data, similar to the function of PCA. For instance, the \"k\" parameter determining the later-feature dimension in matrix factorization is the equavilent to choosing the top k eigenvectors and eigenvalues in PCA. Similarly, autoencoder distills the dimensions of the input data by forcing it through a bottle-neck layer. \n",

    "A deep autoencoder is a type of multi-layer perceptron (MLP) that learning efficient encoding of the input data. An MLP can be used for both classification and regressions by passing the input features foward through several linear layers with non-linear activations in each layer. On the other hand, a typical autoencoder has a symmetrical archtiecture, with layers being the widest on both ends and increasingly tapers toward a bottleneck layer in the center. Rather than predicting a class label or a value given the input, an autoencoder reconstructs the input data using a more efficient encoding (notice the bottleneck layer is significantly smaller than the input feature dimension), or essentially dimensional reduction that force the network to ignore noise in the data. The following code shows an end-to-end training pipeline using Pytorch. "

    "The above graphic visualizes the comparison between the actual and the predicted ratings for 5 different users. We observe that the performance of the recommenders are in fact, far lower than the expected performance during validation. Evidently, both matrix factorization and deep autoencoder had made an average prediction that is far lower than the actual rating (as seen in the ratively light saturation in comparison with the darker blues in the user's actual ratings). We suspect this is mainly due to the sparsity inherent in the data where given a user, the number of frequently played (or liked) songs is far smaller than songs that had only been played a few times. To further examine this, we dicided to plot the mean square both recommenders made in each range of rating (i.e.  from 0.1 to 0.2, from 0.2 to 0.4, etc)."

    "Unsurprisingly, the result matches with our expectation. We see that both recommenders had made far smaller of a mistake when predicting reatings close from 0.1 to 0.4, (a.k.a songs _not_ prefered by the user) while the mean square error gradually increases toward songs most liked by the users. This is, at least partially, in agreement with our hypothesis that the paucity of data in the songs with most liked (with most play counts) has lead to the recommender's poor performance in predicting songs with high ratings. Furthermore, to our surprise, we have also observed that the deep autoencoder performs marginally better than traditional matrix factorization. "

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "The result of our studies had shown the limitation of user-based collaborative filtering. Dispite the obvious advantages of a user-based approach: no need for specific domain knowledge of song (or other products and services) and the ability to rely on user simlarity for prediction, its shortcomings are also well-explored: the prediction of the recommender is heaviliy-biased by the distribution of the data. In an effort to perform dimension reduction while minimizing reconstruction loss, we see that both recommenders have learned to make predictions closely following values of the majority ratings, which is low amongst most songs listened to by users on Last.fm.

    "## Future Work\n",
    "The fact that modern deep learning technique had only shown marginal advantage over traditional matrix factorization had has prompted us to think of ways to imporve existing collaborative filtering techniques. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the autoencoder recommender, one way to mitigate the network from becoming biased toward extremely sparse and heavily skewed data is to regularize the loss during training. For instance, we might multiply the existing loss with a frequency indicator such that we penalize less on frequently appeared, low-rating songs and more on songs that rarely occurs but heavily favored by the users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, we are eager to compare user-based collaborative filtering with content-based approaches even though the later has a more complex input features, for user similarity becomes a more elusive concept when the product or services to recommend becomes increasingly complex (such as those sold on Amazon.com). Ultimately, a combination of the two approaches might be able to compensate pitfalls in one another and lead to better recommendations for the users."
